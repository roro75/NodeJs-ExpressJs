                  | Also known as green flying frogs, or Reinwardt's tree frogs, these amphibians have one feature that sets them apart: The webbing between their toes that helps them glide through the air.

                  While most frogs use their webbed feet exclusively for swimming, black-webbed tree frogs, and other frogs in their genus, use the extra surface area like a sort of built-in hang glider. Opening their feet wide as they leap from tree to tree, they can cover a little more distance than they might otherwise be capable of.

                  This handy adaptation means black-webbed tree frogs can spend most of their time up in the relative safety of the forest canopies in the Southeast Asian subtropics. On the forest floor, theyâ€™d be more exposed to predators.
